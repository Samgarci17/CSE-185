# SBWA
`SBWA` is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. Based of the Burrows Wheelers Aligner Tool, which can be found here https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/

[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) | [Installation](#install) | [Basic Usage](#usage) |  [File formats](#formats)

## Prerequisites
`SBWA` requires the following python libraries to be installed:
- dnazip-bioinfo
- fastq
- minifasta

These packages can be installed with `pip`:
```
pip install dnazip-bioinfo fastq minifasta
```
Note: If you do not have root access, you can run the command above with additional options to install locally:
```
pip install --user dnazip-bioinfo fastq minifasta
```
